# KamLife Coach — Claude Code Instructions

## Git workflow
- **Always work directly on `main`.**
- Commit and push to `main` after every task. No feature branches.
- Never create a PR unless explicitly asked.

## Stack
- TypeScript / Node.js / Express — deployed on Railway
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- WhatsApp via Twilio (`\n\n---\n\n` splits into separate WA messages)
- SMS fallback via `sendCriticalAlert()` — requires `TWILIO_SMS_NUMBER` env var

## Key env vars (Railway)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`
- `TWILIO_SMS_NUMBER` — SMS fallback for critical payment alerts
- `MEDIA_BASE_URL` — CDN root for exercise GIFs and portion images
- `PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID`, `APP_URL`
- `PROACTIVE_PAUSED=true` — global killswitch for all proactive messages
- `FOOD_EVENTS=off` — killswitch for the Event Model (see below); reverts to one row per message

## GIF setup (pending human task)
Set `MEDIA_BASE_URL` in Railway, then upload files to `MEDIA_BASE_URL/ex/<slug>.gif`.
IMPORTANT final step: gifs only serve once each uploaded slug is added to
`UPLOADED_GIF_SLUGS` in `server/exercise-media.ts` (tell Claude — 1-line change).
Without it the code keeps using the safe fallback and uploads do nothing.
Slugs: `squat`, `hip-thrust`, `leg-press`, `leg-curl`, `leg-extension`, `calf-raise`,
`rdl`, `bulgarian-split-squat`, `chest-press`, `chest-fly`, `lat-pulldown`,
`seated-row`, `face-pull`, `lateral-raise`, `shoulder-press`, `bicep-curl`,
`tricep-pushdown`, `cable-kickback`, `push-up`, `plank`, `dead-bug`

## Handler pipeline order
Safety → Onboarding → POPIA → Subscription → Frustration → **Normalizer** → FoodLogMgmt →
EarlyCommands → Media → Workout → Steps → Water → FoodContext → Progress →
Misc → Lifecycle → GPT

### Normalizer (front-door brain)
`classifyIntent` (gpt-4o-mini, fired in background at message entry) classifies AND
rewrites messy phrasing into the canonical forms the deterministic handlers expect —
"I want to go into a building phase" → "change my goal to muscle gain". Applied in
routes.ts before FoodLogMgmt. High-confidence action intents only; numbers in the
canonical must exist in the original (hallucination brake); on timeout/error the
original message proceeds unchanged. Killswitch: `NORMALIZER=off` in Railway.
QUESTION classification also guards the step logger from eating questions.
Voice transcripts get normalized too — media recursion re-enters handleMessage as text.

### Event Model (one message, N events)
A food message is not an event — each labelled meal in it is. Two meals in one message are two
`meal_logs` rows, each with its own label, items and numbers; the day is the sum of its events;
the turn still gets ONE reply. A correction is netted BEFORE the write when it is in the same
message, and lands on the event that holds the food when it is in the next one. The rules are
pure and live in `server/food-identity-correction.ts`; the boundary is `docs/EVENT-MODEL.md`
and §9 of `script/acceptance-hold.ts` (real DB). Killswitch: `FOOD_EVENTS=off` in Railway.

## Never touch without full understanding
- `server/coach-prompt.ts` — any change to food philosophy or coaching voice must preserve goal-aware logic (fat_loss gets portion context, muscle_gain gets encouragement)
- `server/onboarding.ts` — completeOnboarding() is the first impression
- Payment/billing flows in `server/routes/` and `server/scheduler/jobs/business.ts`
