/**
 * SA-English transcript cleaner (blueprint safeguard D).
 *
 * Our clients are voice-first and code-switch ("Yoh, I'm feeling mos kak today, neh?")
 * and use local food words STT mangles ("samp" → "stamp", "morogo", "pap"). One bad
 * transcript poisons the whole reply — a real client said "samp", the system heard
 * "stamp and chicken fingers", and the coach lectured her on food she never mentioned.
 *
 * This sits BETWEEN transcription and the coach: a cheap model repairs SA slang, local
 * food words, and obvious phonetic mishears while preserving meaning, emotion, and
 * profanity. It never answers, summarizes, or changes intent. Fail-open (returns the raw
 * transcript on any error/offline) and killswitch-able (SA_CLEAN=off).

const SA_CLEAN_SYSTEM = `You clean South African English voice-note transcripts before a coach reads them. The speaker is an ordinary South African (often a low-literacy, first-language-not-English client) talking about food, training, and how they feel.

Fix ONLY:
- SA slang/emphasis: mos, neh, yoh, eish, lekker, sharp, sho, shame, ag, hey (keep them, spell them right).
- SA food words STT commonly mangles: samp (NOT "stamp"), morogo, pap, pilchards, chakalaka, vetkoek, umngqusho, kota, mageu/maas, wors, boerewors, umqombothi, magwinya, mngqusho, samp and beans.
- obvious phonetic mishears where the intended word is clear from context.

KEEP everything else exactly: the meaning, the emotion, any anger or profanity, the first-person voice, the length. Do NOT add words, do NOT summarize, do NOT answer, do NOT change what they meant. If the transcript is already clean, return it unchanged.

Return ONLY the cleaned transcript text — no quotes, no notes.`;
