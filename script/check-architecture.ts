/**
 * ARCHITECTURE GOVERNOR — the build fails when the codebase gets more complicated.
 *
 * (2026-07-30, founder: "you will tell the builder don't do this, don't do that. Then after a
 * few commits, they will forget. How do we make it impossible?")
 *
 * He is right, and every previous answer to this was a sentence in a document. Sentences are
 * forgotten in three commits. A red build is never forgotten.
 *
 * This freezes the shape of the system, not its behaviour. Behaviour is what the other 1,357
 * tests are for. This asks one question no test suite asks: IS THERE MORE OF EVERYTHING THAN
 * THERE WAS YESTERDAY?
 *
 * Because that is the actual disease. 60,656 lines, 333 pattern lists, 30 files each deciding
 * what a message means, three separate paths that can answer a client. Nobody chose that. It
 * accumulated, one locally-reasonable fix at a time, because nothing in the build ever said no.
 *
 * THE RULE: every number below may FALL. None may RISE. When one falls, this fails too — and
 * tells you to lower the budget, so the win is locked in and can never quietly leak back. Same
 * measure-freeze-migrate contract as check-file-sizes, check-sast and check-names.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx script/check-architecture.ts   (wired into `npm test`)
